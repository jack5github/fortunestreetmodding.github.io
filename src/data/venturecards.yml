# Venture Cards

# defaultEasy: Whether the card is found in easy mode by default.
# defaultStandard: Whether the card is found in standard mode by default.
# description: The in-game description of the card.
# descriptionExtra (optional): An add-on to the in-game description in case it is not descriptive enough.
# effect: The group name for cards with similar effects. This is an abstraction of the existing groups denoted in the in-game descriptions before the exclamation mark. Effect groups should have between 4-6 cards in them, unless no other cards satisfy the requirements, or abstracting the group would create groups that are too small.
# TODO: Readjust ranks
# rank: The power of a card within an effect group, ranging between 0 and 4 (D, C, B, A, S). Power is measured by how devastating the effect is with regards to the sentiment and the other cards in the group with similar effects. In order to avoid bias, a card's power is strictly ordered compared to other cards in its effect group. In cases where there are not enough unique power levels to fill all the ranks, prefer the ranks closest to 2 (B), rounding up if necessary. (This philosophy may be changed at a later date once the ranking system is put into practice.)
# sentiment: How beneficial the effect is to the player who draws the card (-1 = negative, 0 = neutral, 1 = positive).
